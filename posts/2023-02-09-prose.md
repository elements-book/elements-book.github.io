Yesterday the Association of American Publishers (AAP) unveiled the 105 finalists and 40 Category winners for the 47^th^ Annual [PROSE Awards](https://proseawards.com) honouring scholarly works published in 2023.

We are very proud to say that the _Elements of ∞-Category Theory_ won the PROSE Award in the Mathematics and Statistics category. Consequently, it is now eligible for the next level of PROSE honours, the Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences and Mathematics, which will be announced in coming weeks.

**So watch this space!!!**

We would again like to thank our partners and families for nurturing and inspiring us throughout the development of this book (and well beyond). Without them none of this would have been possible.

We would also like to extend particular thanks to our editor, Kaitlin Leach, for all of her support throughout the development of The Elements and for nominating it for this award.
